## What functionality does it provide?

1. Reading and displaying of a PGM (Portable Gray Map), or <a href="../../Source/BiomSharp/BiomSharp/Imaging/Wsq#readme" target="_blank">WSQ-encoded</a> 8-bit gray-scale image which are common image formats used for the exchange of fingerprint images.
1. Integration of an imaging plugin for Windows and a plugin that utilizes <a href="https://github.com/SixLabors/ImageSharp" target="_blank">ImageSharp</a> to provide many image formats which is not Windows-specific.
1. Incorporation of the latest (v2.2) of the <a href="https://www.nist.gov/services-resources/software/nfiq-2" target="_blank">NIST-NFIQ2</a> "that links image quality of optical and ink 500 PPI fingerprints to operational recognition performance"

## Status

View this application as a work/test bench. It will be updated often (as we can), and will provide more useful functionality in future.
