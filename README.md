# BiomSharp

BiomSharp, or 'Biom#', is a set of C# libraries and demo applications that provide easier and more consistent management of biometric data, as well as an abstraction framework for working with various biometric sensors. Some of the biometric functions are provided as C# class libraries that interoperate with C/C++ native libraries.
